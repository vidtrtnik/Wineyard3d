# Wineyard3d
3D game engine, written in Javascript and WebGL 2. 

<b>Wineyard3d</b> is a 3D game engine, written in <b>Javascript</b> and <b>WebGL 2</b>. 
It is in development since 2018. I wrote this engine for my personal projects.
Wineyard3D runs in all web browsers supported by WebGL 1.0.

Currently, Wineyard3D can only load models which are stored in proprietary format "<b>wy3dm</b>" <i>(Wineyard 3D model)</i>. Wineyard 3D model file contains unpacked .obj vertices and texture vertices and some additional data. Converter from .obj to .wy3dm is also available on my github repository.

Currently, Wineyard3D only supports textures in 8-bit PNG format, without alpha channel. Texture resolution must be power of 2.
